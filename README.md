submitted to CIKM 2025 

## Abstract 

Explainable AI (XAI) for time series is an important topic and recent efforts in this area have resulted in many new 
explanation methods. Additionally, new approaches were proposed to evaluate XAI methods, both quantitatively and 
qualitatively through domain expertise or user studies.
Despite progress in XAI for time series, its practical application for achieving measurable benefits remains unclear.
This paper bridges this gap by proposing and evaluating a novel, general methodology for
**XAI-based data reduction on time series (drXAI)**. We analyse XAI in action on the task of data reduction for time 
series classification. We first study channel selection for multivariate time series classification (MTSC). We show that
*drXAI* can reduce the data by up to 88\% on big datasets (>50 channels), significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
channel selection methods. Next, we apply the *drXAI* algorithm for time point selection in univariate time series 
classification (UTSC). We show that our XAI-based algorithm can reduce the data by up to 95\% in some cases (>4k length),
while preserving or improving the classification accuracy. Finally, we show that XAI-selection can be done using fast 
classifiers (e.g., Minirocket) and fast XAI methods (e.g., Feature Ablation): this enables the use of more complex and 
accurate algorithms such as ConvTran, which require significant memory resources for long time series.
Our experiments show that XAI can be used effectively for data reduction on the TSC task, with significant and 
measurable benefits, opening a path to applying XAI to other time series tasks.
